Prediction models for classifying Kazakh words into CEFR levels (A1â€“C1) based on human-labeled data

Kazakh language is an endangered and low-resource language that does not have a set of criterias for assesing the complexity of certain words. 
This repository aims to address this gap by leveraging machine learning. By using model parameters and labels from native speakers, we can systematically evaluate word difficulty levels.

When assessing word complexity in Kazakh, several key factors are considered, aligning with both the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and Kazakh linguistic characteristics:

* **Morphological Complexity**
* **Syllable Count**
* Lexical Origin
* Phonetic Complexity
* **Frequency of Use**
* **Semantic Complexity**

Currently, the model incorporates the bolded features.
